TeachPlay — License Explanation

Chosen license: Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0)

What this means (plain language):
- You may copy, share and adapt the project materials for personal, educational, or research purposes.
- You must give credit to the project authors when reusing or adapting the materials.
- You may NOT use the project (code, assets, documentation) for commercial purposes without an explicit commercial license from the project owner.

Important notes about code vs content:
- Creative Commons licenses are primarily designed for creative works (documentation, designs, images). They are not recommended for source code because the open-source/licensing ecosystem for code expects more specific terms.
- If you want to restrict commercial use of the source code, recommended options:
  1. Business Source License (BSL): Keep source available, restrict production/commercial use for a time period, then convert to an open-source license (e.g., after 3 years).
  2. Dual licensing: Keep a source-available non-commercial license for general users and offer a paid commercial license to businesses.
  3. Custom non-commercial clause on top of a permissive license (requires legal review) — less recommended because it can create ambiguity.

Suggested project policy (practical):
- Keep project documentation, images and examples under CC BY-NC 4.0 (this file and `LICENSE`).
- For code, either:
  - Use a permissive license (MIT/Apache-2.0) for the code but protect certain assets with CC BY-NC, and offer a paid commercial license if required; or
  - Use BSL for code to explicitly restrict commercial production use for a chosen duration.

How to get a commercial license:
- Provide an email contact (replace `<your-email@example.com>` in `LICENSE`) for inquiries.
- Example commercial-license workflow:
  1. Company contacts project owner with use-case.
  2. Owner issues a paid commercial license (negotiated terms) or a written permission to use under specific conditions.
  3. Optionally, the owner may publish a `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` template with basic terms and pricing.

Pros and cons of CC BY-NC for this project:
- Pros:
  - Simple to understand for non-lawyers.
  - Clear non-commercial restriction for documentation and assets.
- Cons:
  - Not standard for source code; may confuse contributors.
  - Commercial restrictions can limit adoption and contributions from companies.

If you prefer, I can:
- Replace the LICENSE with BSL or a code-friendly non-commercial approach.
- Add a `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` template.
- Add a short license notice to `README.md` and `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`.
