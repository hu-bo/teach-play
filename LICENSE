Notes and recommendations:
- This license is primarily intended for creative works (documentation, designs, assets). For code, CC licenses are not recommended. If you want a clear non-commercial restriction for code, consider combining a permissive license for code for personal use with a separate commercial license offer, or use a Business Source License (BSL) for time-limited source-available restrictions.
- If you later want to allow commercial use, you can relicense or provide a dual-license/commercial license on request.
